# Intro üåà

<p>Welcome to my .dotfiles repo! Here you will find my .dotfiles, mostly from ~/.config folder</p>

# Requirements üß∞

You will need to install some packages to make the dotfiles work
<br>
Use the `pre-install.sh` script to install all needed packages right away!

### You will also need YAY installed! <br>
Follow the guide on this repo: https://github.com/Jguer/yay
<br>
<br>
# How to use them üíª

1 | Git Clone this repo using:<br>
` git clone https://github.com/WooxHimself/ArchDotties/ `
<br>
<br>
2 | Choose which configs you like and want to use
<br>
<br>
3 | Make a backup of your old configs in case by using:<br>
`cp ~/.config ~/.config.backup/`
<br>
<br>
3 | Copy them to your `~/.config` folder: <br>
`cp -r ArchDotties/* ~/.config`
<br>
<br>

### THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR OLD ONES <br>

But if you made a backup in step 3 you can rollback anytime using: <br>

`mv ~/.config.backup/ ~/.config/` <br>
<br>
<br>
4 | Reboot or restart your WM/DE and you should see the changes!
